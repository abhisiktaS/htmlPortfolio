<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently a student pursuin Bachelors in Computer Science. I am always eager to learn and enhance my knowledge.
  I truly believe that the knowledge and skills I acquire from hard work and consistency are what actually define me.
  i am always eager to learn about new things and preserve the knowledge gained from pratical experiences
</p>

<p>I am an avid reader; Detective and thriller genres being my favourite. I love to listen to music and appreciate good music of any language.
  I would love to learn musical instruments in the near future. I also love to watch movies, web series, anime etc. They say movies can't affect your life but 
  had I not wathced movies I would not have any self development. I literally owe movies and book my life.
